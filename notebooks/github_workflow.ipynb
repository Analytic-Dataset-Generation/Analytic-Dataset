    "### 1.0. Preface\n",
    "There are always at least two ways of doing git operations, one is in **GitHub Desktop**, the other is using **command line**. The command line approach is introduced in this edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full cycle of editing, updating code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetch/Pull ➡️ Edit code ➡️ Commit ➡️ Push\n",

    "![workflow cycle](images/1.0-cycle.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. The absolute first step: Clone the repository\n",
    "The syntax is `git clone <url>`. You can find the url in the corresponding GitHub repo page.\n",
    "![github clone url](images/1.1-clone.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open terminal, go to the directory you would like the folder to be by using `cd` command\n",
    "2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/Faye-yufan/analytics-dataset.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Fetching and Pulling\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is amost always to get the latest data in remote repo if you would like to work on the project on top of the newest verion.\n",
    "You can run either `$ git fetch <remote>` or `$ git pull <remote>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between `fectch` and `pull` will be explained in details in section 2.2.1.\n",

    "In order to stage a file, we run `git add`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Commit**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Basically to commit is to record your changes with a high-level explanation. This is done by `git commit -m \"<message>\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Pushing\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: `git push <remote> <branch>`. \n"
