# Overview
The AutoGen (analyticsdf) is a Python library that allows you to generate synthetic data with any statistical characteristics you want.

## Features
This library provides a set of functionality to enable the specification and generation of a wide range of datasets with specified statistical characteristics. Specification includes the predictor matrix and the response vector.
Some common congifuration:
* High correlation and multi-collinearity among predictor variables
* Interaction effects between variables
* Skewed distributions of predictor and response variables
* Nonlinear relationships between predictor and response variables

Check the [analyticsdf documentation](https://faye-yufan.github.io/analytics-dataset/) for more details.
